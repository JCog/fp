% The function PlayEffect (func_802D829C) is used to display hundreds of different special effects,
% from energy beams and thunder bolts to falling leaves and floating flowers.

% There are 0x87 major effect types/categories, most with multiple variations.
% The effect type indexes a jump table at 802DA258 (to 802DA474) via [802D8534].

% The first four digits are the type, the second four is the subtype.
% Subtype FFFF indiciates that there is no subtype. Additional args begin immediately.
